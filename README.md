# CatchCheck
osu!catch plugin for mapset verifier

## Included Checks
- Spinner gap* (before and after)
- Edge dash (experimental)
- Hyperdash

\* if previous or next object is a spinner then it will be count as minor because it's not a problem at all.

## TODO
- Edge dash to hyperdash/dash (Rain + Overdose)
- Combo limit
- Dash (very unlikely)
- Spinner presence
- AR = OD check
